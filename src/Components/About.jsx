              I'm a passionate Developer, with strong administrative and

              My interest in web development started back last year when I was
              working with an E-Commerce Affiliate Platform in which they were
              facing problems to make good web applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              As I grow and flourish as a Developer, one thing which keeps me
              going is my inquisitiveness for discovering new things every day.
            </li>

              Fast Forwarding to today, I built a number of web applications and
              5 major projects. Learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership,
              and communication. After months of rigorous training, here I am
              looking for an opportunity as a full stack web developer.
